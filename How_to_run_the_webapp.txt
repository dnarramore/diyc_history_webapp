For the data loading app:

Put the new file out on the S3 server

The version that runs is:
C:\Users\dnarr\DIYC_History_app\load_logs.py

In the terminal of VS Code, navigate to C:\Users\dnarr\DIYC_History_app

type in py load_logs.py to run the program




For the webapp:
Start the EC2 instance
RDP to it (you might need a new RDP file).  password comes from the DIYCHISTORY_keypair.pem on my local machine.  
The RDP tab in AWS/EC2 will create it for you given the .pem file

On the remote server, start CMD, and navigate to Apache24/bin, then run httpd.exe (we don't have to do this if we run the .bat file)

Open VS Code and navigate to the Python home: C:\Users\Administrator\Appdata\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Python... something

In the terminal, run python app.py

then open a browser and open http://localhost:8080


To get to the webapp remotely:
http://52.2.49.89:8080/
on startup of the EC2 server, it runs run_diyc_history_search_app.bat. It activates the virtual environment and starts running app.py

To make changes to the code (html or python), you have to stop it (Ctrl + c then type Y) in the terminal
Then restart it by running he .bat file again from the terminal:
C:\Program Files\Python313\diyc_history_search_app>run_diyc_history_search_app.bat

Files are here:  C:\Program Files\Python313\diyc_history_search_app

Print statements will appear in the console
